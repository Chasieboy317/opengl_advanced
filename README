To compile the program:
	run the command "make" from the root folder

To run the program:
	running the command "make run" will start the program in default mode with one model, sphere.obj and texturing not enable
	to run the program with various arguments, run "./prac1 [model] [true/false to load a texture]"
	you can load multiple objects into the scene by running a command like "./prac1 cube.obj sphere.obj"
	to load a texture, add the words 'true' or 'false' at the end of the command "./prac1 cube.obj true" will load a texture onto the cube

NOTE: 
	There aren't any models that have texture co-ordinates, therefore the textures will not show properly on the model

Controls:
	Q,E - orbit the camera about the y-axis, clockwise or anti-clockwise
	W - move the camera forward 
	A,D - move the camera left or right 
	S - move the camera backwards 
	Z,C - Scale the objects
	X - Cycle through the axes of scaling
	UP - translate the selected object up along the y-axis
	DOWN - translate the selected object down along the y-axis
	LEFT - translate the selected object left along the x-axis
	RIGHT - translate the selected object right along the x-axis
	RALT - translate the selected object forwards along the z-axis
	RCTRL - translate the selected object backwards along the z-axis
	SPACE - change the object that is selected
	Y - orbit all the lights around the center of the world
	ESC - exit the program
